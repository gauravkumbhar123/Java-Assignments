Difference between HashSet, LinkedHashSet, And TreeSet
Basis	                   LINKEDHASHSET	                                                     HASHSET	                                                    TREESET
Internal Storage	Uses LinkedHashMap for object Storage	Uses HashMap for object Storage	                   Uses TreeMap for object Storage
Insertion order	It maintains	                                                It does not maintain	                It maintains the order as per the comparator mentioned.
Null Values	Only one Null Object is allowed.	                 Only one Null Object is allowed.	                        Doesn’t allow Null Objects.
Performance	It is Slower compared to both.	                  Better performance as compared to other two.	            Better than LinkedHashSet, but lacks during insertion deletion operation , since it has to sort itself everytime.
When To Use	If you want to maintain insertion order	If insertion order doesn’t matters.	                     When we need to sort as per some comparator.

1.Throwable class

The Throwable class is the superclass of every error and exception in the Java language.
 Only objects that are one of the subclasses this class are thrown by any “Java Virtual Machine” or may be thrown by the Java throw statement. For the motives of checking of exceptions during compile-time, 
Throwable and any subclass of Throwable which is not also a subclass of either Error or RuntimeException are considered as checked exceptions.
Throwable class is the root class of Java Exception Hierarchy and is inherited by two subclasses: 
1.Exception 
2.Error 
The throwable class implements Serializable Interface and the direct known classes to Throwable are Error and Exception. 
Throwable contains a snapshot of the execution stack of its thread at the time it was created. It can also contain a message string that gives more information about the error. It can also suppress other throwables from being propagated. 
If a user wants to create his own, custom throwable, then he/she can extend Throwable class.

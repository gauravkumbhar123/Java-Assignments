Q.Difference between ‘==’ and ‘.equals()’

Equality operator “==”

Equality operator can be used to compare primitives but when you compare objects using ==, it just compares reference not the actual content of the objects.

Equals methods:

If you want to compare the actual content of the object, then you need to override equals method in your class.
 If you do not override object’s class equals method, then it behaves same as "==" and compares references only. 

Difference between equals() and == in java
== is operator whereas equals is method in java.
== is recommended to compare primitives whereas equals method is recommended to compare the actual content of objects.
Equals method can be overridden but you can’t override behavior of “==” operator
== can be used with primitives and objects but you can’t use equals method with primitives.
